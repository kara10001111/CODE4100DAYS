## Note
* This is not the original #100DaysOfCode repo. This is just a modified or simplified version as I am lazy and don't like to read a lot.
* If you have any questions or ideas about 100DaysOfCode (or other ideas), feel free to reach out the creator on Twitter: [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away)
* Check out [the Official Site](http://100daysofcode.com/) for the #100DaysOfCode movement. Connect with others on the platform of your choice from this list: www.100DaysOfCode.com/connect
* Follow [Alex, creator of #100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/ka11away) & [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
* Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
* If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just reach out the creator on Twitter: [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away)
