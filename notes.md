Since I'm doing **unlearn to learn** approach in improving my coding skills, these are the links and resources that I used and had some much updated and easy to understand guides:
* [How to Sync and Update a Forked Repository](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-sync-and-update-a-forked-repo/#:~:text=Getting%20started&text=Forks%20allows%20you%20have%20to,contributions%20to%20the%20original%20project.)
* [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git)
*
